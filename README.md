# The AIE Nomads Modpack
A technology-focused modpack from the Nomads of Alea Iacta Est.

This modpack is the 1.10 update of the official modpack for the [Nomads](http://wiki.aie-guild.org/index.php?title=AIE_Nomads) of [Alea Iacta Est](https://aie-guild.org/) (AIE) social gaming community.  Our community of thousands is derived from a diverse group of people seeking adventure and enjoy game content in a family-friendly environment built on mutual courtesy and respect. Like our community, this modpack is diverse and represents the aspects of other modpacks we've found value in.

We've focused on what we consider to be a balanced combination of mods that combine a strong resource and agricultural component (Biomes O' Plenty, Natura, Pam's Harvestcraft, and Forestry) and a rich crafting progression (Mekanism, Ender IO, Applied Energistics) in a world where the simple joy of architecture and aesthetics has a place (Chisel 2, Realistic Terrain Generator).  There is no magic, aside from what's in vanilla Minecraft and magic in the Asimov sense.

This is a live modpack that will continually evolve and be tweaked to suit the desires of our community as we evolve with it. It is, eternally, a work in progress.

All development of this modpack will be done on [GitHub](https://github.com/AIE-Guild/AIE-Nomads-Modpack) and released on [Curse](http://www.curse.com/modpacks/minecraft/230885-aie-nomads). We welcome constructive criticism and participation, please visit the [official thread in our forums](http://forum.myextralife.com/topic/56351-aie-nomads-modpack/).
