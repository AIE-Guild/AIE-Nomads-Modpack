# The AIE Nomads Modpack
A technology-focused modpack from the nomads of Alea Iacta Est.

This modpack is the official modpack for the Nomads of Alea Iacta Est (AIE) social gaming community.  Both AIE and the Nomads are diverse groups, and this modpack reflects it.  We admit that most of us are noobish when it comes to Minecraft, but this modpack represents the aspects of other modpacks we've found value in.  It is, eternally, a work in progress.  

We've focused on what we consider to be a balanced combination of mods that combine a strong resource and argicultural component (Biome O' Plenty, Natura, Pam's Harvestcraft, and Forestry) and a rich crafting progression (Railcraft, Minefactory Reloaded, Ender IO, Thermal Expansion, Big Reactors) in a world where the simple joy of architecture and aesthetics has a place (Chisel 2, Carpenters' Blocks).  We've added aspects of challenge, like Hunger Overhaul, but we will be tweaking it to appeal to the broader interests of our community.  We believe hunger should be an important factor, but not so much of a factor that you can't enjoy the rest of the game.

All development of this modpack will be done on [GitHub](https://github.com/AIE-Guild/AIE-Nomads-Modpack) and released on [Curse](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/modpacks/230885-aie-nomads). We welcome constructive criticism and participation, please visit the [official thread in our forums](http://forum.myextralife.com/topic/56351-aie-nomads-modpack/).
